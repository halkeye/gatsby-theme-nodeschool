The `allowIndex` option is a boolean. By default it is false. What this means is that if you try to open your root page (i.e. `index`), the website will redirect you to your default language. If you set it to true, you will allow your index page to be opened. However, that may have some unexpected results and is strongly discouraged. 

**Use it only if you know what you are doing!**
